                \item If $F \perp V$: No collision occurs
                \item Discrete footfalls: $F \not\perp V$: Kinetic energy is lost~\cite{Biewener2018}
                % Discrete footfalls preclude a consistent perpendicular relationship~\cite{Biewener2018}
                % \item Kinetic energy is lost as ground reaction force does mechanical work on centre of mass ($CoM$)
                % \item Quantified: Mechanical cost of transport ($CoT_{mech}$)
            \end{itemize}%
            Key advantages:~\cite{Lee2013}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \acrfull{com} dynamics get considered in every instance of contact during stride
                \item Dimensionless % , allowing comparisons across species of vastly different size and comparisons across gravity conditions
                \item Independent of a priori models % of \acrshort{com} mechanics applies equally to any gait
                \item Explains the mechanical \acrfull{cot} from first principles

The collision angle $\phi$ is the deviation of the orthogonal relation between $F$ and $V$. (Adapted from~\cite{Lee2011}, p. 4)}%

\note[itemize]{%
    \item Mechanics: Modeled in terms of “inelastic” collisions by limb with ground
    \item If $F \perp V$: No collision occurs: No work done at \acrshort{com},~\eg wheel without rim but infinite spokes
    \item Intermittent foot contacts during legged locomotion result in relatively abrupt, collision-like changes in \acrshort{com} direction, which require mechanical work
    \item Dimensionless, allowing comparisons across species of vastly different size and comparisons across gravity conditions
    \item Independent of a priori models of \acrshort{com} mechanics: applies equally to any gait
