\vspace{10mm}

Firstly I would like to thank my advisor  Dr.-Ing. Daniel Renjewski for his dedicated involvement and support through the past few months. He made this thesis possible in the first place. Furthermore, I want to thank Julian Schausberger as the second reader of this thesis for his open ears and insightful comments. I would also like to offer my gratitude to my friend, Lilla Nagy, who I collaborated with through the years while at~\glsxtrfull{tum}. Thank you for always being dependable and I wish you all the best in your academic pursuits. A big thank you to Melina Neu√ü for always being available to supply me with the parts and the laughs needed to get through this project. Lastly but most importantly, I am eternally grateful to my parents, Klaus and Brigitta Schausberger, who have always given me a free hand in my career decisions and supported me in everything I have done. Thank you.
