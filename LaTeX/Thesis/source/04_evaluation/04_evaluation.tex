\label{sec:evaluation}

The overall goal of this project is to obtain a control law via reverse engineering the model dynamics to answers the following question: How must the~\glsxtrshort{aea} be set in relation to$~\gls{rho}$ to get a touchdown with the current state$~\begin{bmatrix} \gls{q} & \dot{\gls{q}} \end{bmatrix}^\textrm{T}$ so that the periodicity of the gait is preserved in the subsequent step? By simulating and analyzing the dynamics of the entire system, an attempt is made to deduce a control law. The ideal case would be to find a constant offset which, independent of the magnitude of the velocity vector$~\gls{v}_{CH}$, always leads to a periodic solution. \\

To find an answer to this question, the optimizer was left to find a solution as periodic as possible via the cost function from equation~\ref{eq:objective-function}. A preliminary sweep in a feasible range was performed considering$~\gls{GM}_h$ and$~\gls{theta-es}_{,~k}$ separately, in order to observe a tendency of their influence in the behavior of the system. Note that varying$~\gls{theta-es}_{,~k}$ does not increase the velocity significantly, however, increasing the gain of the hip motor$~\gls{GM}_h$ does, since this straightly affects the output voltage of the motors, but the system also becomes increasingly unstable, to the point where it is not able to walk anymore.$~\gls{theta-fs}_{,~k}$ was excluded from the sweep as it seems to have a much more erratic behavior. Additionally, since any deviation from$~\gls{theta-es}_{,~h}$ seemed to negatively affect the robustness of the system, this parameter was left at the default value of 5. \\

Finding appropriate initial parameters for a stable gait is one of the biggest challenges in modelling a spring-mass biped, which often turns out to be time-consuming and tedious. As it is not possible to analytically deduce the dependence of the stability of the system on the initial parameters, most of them have to be found through experiments. In addition, even small disturbances of the permissible parameters can quickly lead to instability of the entire system. In this project, most of the parameters were chosen according to appropriate experimental data from~\citeauthor*{Geng2006}~\cite{Geng2006} and the remaining ones were determined by sweeping within a reasonable range. The parameters obtained from the sweep consist of

\begin{align}
    \begin{cases}
        \gls{theta-es}_{,~k} = -4.25  \\
        \gls{theta-fs}_{,~h} =~\text{\glsxtrshort{aea}} = \frac{15}{1 + e^{0.2 \cdot \gls{rho} + 4}} - 25  \\
        \gls{GM}_h = 1.6
    \end{cases}      
    \label{eq:results}%
\end{align}

The resulting walking gait using the parameters from equation~\ref{eq:results} is summarized in table~\ref{tab:results}. The results of the performed~\glsxtrshort{mca} are summarized in table~\ref{tab:mca}.

Compared to mammals from the literature, the~\glsxtrshort{mcot} of the robot is relatively high. Humans, for example, walk with~\glsxtrshort{mcot} $\approx 0.08$ and run with~\glsxtrshort{mcot} $\approx 0.28$~\cite{Lee2013}. Figure~\ref{fig:collision-based-analysis} shows~\gls{Theta},~\gls{Lambda} and~\gls{Phi} as a fraction of their sum in a ternary diagram. The filled circles indicate bipedal gaits and the filled squares indicate quadrupedal gaits. The color of the symbols indicate the collision fraction~\gls{kappa} with red indicating$~\kappa = 1$ and purple$~\kappa = 0$ (for spectrum of intermediate colors, see color scale at right).~\cite{Lee2013}

Figure~\ref{fig:velocity-vectors} shows the velocity vectors$~\gls{v}_{\glsxtrshort{com}}$ at touchdown (\subref{fig:velocity-vectors-touchdown}) and at~\glsxtrshort{vlo}$_{1}$ (\subref{fig:velocity-vectors-vlo}). At the beginning of the velocity vectors the leg position is shown schematically, where the hip, knee and ankle joints are drawn as circles. Accordingly, it can be seen that the robot performs the touchdown with a fully extended knee if$~\gls{GM}_h \geq 1.6$. With a$~\gls{GM}_h$ of 1.4, the swing leg of the robot is not fast enough to reach an extended knee at touchdown. The velocity vectors at touchdown are always in the fourth quadrant, which means that the robot has a positive horizontal forward velocity ($\gls{v}_{\glsxtrshort{com}_x} > 0\,\textrm{\si{\metre\per\second}}$) and a negative vertical velocity ($\gls{v}_{\glsxtrshort{com}_y} < 0\,\textrm{\si{\metre\per\second}}$), in other words, the torso falls forward and is caught by the swing leg at touchdown. The velocity vectors at~\glsxtrshort{vlo}$_{1}$ are always in the first quadrant, which means that the robot has a positive horizontal as well as vertical velocity ($\gls{v}_{\glsxtrshort{com}_x}~\land~\gls{v}_{\glsxtrshort{com}_y} > 0\,\textrm{\si{\metre\per\second}}$). A single step is completed when the swing leg attains ground contact and the~\glsxtrshort{com} is orthogonally above the second foot point ($\gls{x}_{\glsxtrshort{com}} = \gls{x}_{FP_2}$). The colors refer to the different motor gains, with red representing the lowest with$~\gls{GM}_h = 1.4$, and blue the highest with$~\gls{GM}_h = 1.8$. The angle of the velocity vector tends to get steeper the larger the motor gain$~\gls{GM}_h$,~\ie the faster the robot runs. A steeper velocity vector has more vertical than horizontal velocity and thus leads to a steeper angle of attack~\gls{alpha}.

Figure~\ref{fig:com-horizontal-velocity} shows the trajectory of the horizontal velocity of the~\glsxtrshort{com} during the motion. For legibility purposes, the first $10\,\textrm{\si{\second}}$ of movement are displayed. The robot moves with an average forward velocity of $0.8379\,\textrm{\si{\metre\per\second}}$. The amplitude of the horizontal velocity ranges from a maximum of $1.7803\,\textrm{\si{\metre\per\second}}$ to a minimum of $-0.7106\,\textrm{\si{\metre\per\second}}$. In order to minimize the energy consumption of the system, the amplitude deflection should be reduced and negative forward velocities avoided. The trajectory of the vertical velocity of the~\glsxtrlong{com} during the motion of the robot is shown in appendix~\ref{app:B}.

\section{Summary}

This chapter presents the results and evaluates the implemented controller with quantitative parameters based on the~\glsxtrlong{mca}. In the course of this work, most of the parameters were chosen according to appropriate experimental data from~\citeauthor*{Geng2006}~\cite{Geng2006} and the remaining ones were determined by sweeping within a reasonable range. The phase plot reveals that the robot is asymptotically stable in its gait. Compared to mammals from the literature, the~\glsxtrshort{mcot} of the robot is relatively high~\cite{Lee2013}. Although a periodic gait has been found, it is not energy efficient. Studying the velocities, it can be seen that the amplitude deflection of the horizontal velocity is quite large and even becomes negative - resulting in a negative horizontal displacement of the robot with a consequently high energy consumption, which should be addressed in further work.
