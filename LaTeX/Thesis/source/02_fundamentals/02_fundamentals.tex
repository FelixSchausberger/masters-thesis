Over millions of years of evolution, living creatures have developed various modes of locomotion, so-called gaits, which can be distinguished by their movement. For example, locomotion patterns with legs can be categorized via temporary footfall patterns. The analysis of terrestrial legged locomotion in the last half century has focused mainly on strategies for mechanical energy recovery during walking and running~\cite{Lee2011}. Two pioneers of kinematic measurement are {\'E}tienne-Jules Marey (1830 - 1904) and Eadweard Muybridge (1830 - 1904). The former published studies on the movements of human limbs as early as 1873, while the latter became famous by demonstrating that a horse at a trot lifts all four of its feet off the ground simultaneously at certain times.~\cite{Baker2007} In the mid-1960s,~\citeauthor{Hildebrand1965}~\cite{Hildebrand1965} and others used cine films at a frame rate of 128 and $64\,\textrm{\si{\fps}}$ to distinguish gaits of terrestrial legged animals by such means as the duty cycle or limb contact phases. About a decade later,~\citeauthor{Cavagna1977}~\cite{Cavagna1977} revolutionized the understanding of animal locomotion by defining~\glsxtrfull{com} mechanics using a point mass model and force plate measurements of the whole animal. Their comparison of walking and running reduced gait complexity by proposing that separate and mutually exclusive mechanisms act to exchange energy during the gait phase, such as anti-phase to in-phase kinetics and potential energy fluctuations. The same authors induced today's widely accepted paradigm of conceptualizing walking as an~\glsxtrfull{ip} and running as a compliant~\glsxtrfull{slip}.~\cite{Lee2013} While walking, the mechanical energy of the~\glsxtrshort{com} remains nearly constant while kinetic and potential energies interchange oscillatorily, causing the~\glsxtrshort{com} to ascend over the supporting limb in mid-stance and fall forward into the next step. During running, however, this exchange is not possible because the~\glsxtrshort{com} attains its lowest point in mid-stance, where the kinetic energy is also low. For this reason, running gaits are assumed as a spring-mass mechanism in which the interaction between the~\glsxtrshort{com} and the ground allows for the storage and return of elastic strain energy in rather compliant legs.~\cite{Lee2011}

\section{Summary}

Locomotion is equally fundamental to all living things. Nature provides a myriad of various biological forms and functions to maneuver energy efficiently, agilely and safely through even the most hazardous environments, which evolved over the course of millions of years of evolution.~\cite{Lee2018} The analysis of terrestrial legged locomotion in the last half century has focused mainly on strategies for mechanical energy recovery during walking and running~\cite{Lee2011}. Legged locomotion can be classified in symmetrical and asymmetrical gaits, according to the phase relationship of the left-right pairs of legs, regardless of the number of pairs. A common definition depicts that symmetrical gaits involve both legs on the same side moving together whereas asymmetrical gaits involve diagonally opposite pairs of legs moving together. Models have been developed to further analyze terrestrial legged locomotion and can be classified based on the phase relationship of the kinetic and potential energy oscillations. Two of the most influential models for gait analysis for bipedal, quadrupedal, and multi-legged locomotion are the~\glsxtrfull{slip} model for running, where the energy oscillations are in phase,~\ie the kinetic and potential energy both reach a minimum at mid-stance, and the~\glsxtrfull{ip} model for walking, where the energy oscillations are out of phase.~\cite{Lee2018} Energy consumption and efficiency of movement patterns in biological and artificial systems can be quantified with the~\glsxtrfull{mca}. This method involves calculating and comparing the mechanical work done by the system,~\ie the force applied to and the displacement of the system, as well as the metabolic energy consumption, to quantify the overall efficiency of the movement.~\cite{Biewener2018}
