Specify fixed hip angle speed -> Let optimizer adjust offset

Modulate hip motor gain:
Is that capped, normalized? If not you get hip voltage -> from this you get speed
(For motor there is proportionality from voltage - speed and current - torque)
Does hip motor gain change output voltage of motor? If yes, speed vector controllable via hip motor gain

Establish relationship between initial hip velocity and hip velocity between VLO and touchdown - convergence?

The later we know how fast we are the harder it will be to adjust this offset.

Geng - figure of speed to hip motor gain
