Drawing upper body stabilization:
Draw in cycles, with patch (single / double support, touchdown)
Angle of the upper body against world
Draw opposite side opposite so that you can see complete cycle

How to incorporate velocity angle?
Set AEA relative to velocity vector
Does velocity angle lead to stable (continuous) solutions with free upper body?

Extend optimizer:
Knee and hip angles (with exponential penalty)
Include angular velocities

Optimizer left to find velocity angle
vary direction of velocity vector (determine touchdown angle relative to direction of velocity)
What do velocity vectors (CoM, hip) look like at touchdown? Plot [x, y] relative to origin (scatter, constant?), cross in the fourth quadrant (possibly quiver function)
Which parameters can be varied to cause scattering of the vector?
Keep the magnitude of the vector the same

Can one find a touchdown angle for a set of initial conditions for which one finds a periodic solution? Is there a periodic solution relative to the velocity angle?

upper body may have different frequencies (step frequency, half frequency and mirror), both acceptable

Is there a periodic solution relative to the velocity angle?
Does velocity vector scatter in direction?
Can we align angles relative to velocity vector to get periodic solutions?
How does change in velocity vector affect direction and magnitude?
